# Background

When collaborating with others on a react project, we create components so that we could reuse it again and again. However, it is quite difficult to know what does it look like for components that created from other so at the end we might be creating duplicated components. On top of that, sometimes, when we revisit our own project, we might also forget the design of our own components too. 

To solve that, we want an environment where we could view all the components and are able to interact with it using different props value. 

Storybook could help in this case. In this article, we will demonstrate how to setup a simple storybook and deploy it to chromatic so that your teammate could access via a link.
